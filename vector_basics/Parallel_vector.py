## this code gives you the inner product of two vectors to test of the vectors are parallel
import numpy as np
from vectors import Point, Vector


v = np.array([-7.579,-7.88])
w = np.array([22.737,23.64])

v = vector([-7.579,-7.88])

print(v.Vector.parallel(w))
vw_para = np.dot(v,w)
print(vw_para)


## vectors are parallel if one vector is a scalar multiple of other vector

## two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is 0
# 0 vector is parallel and orthogonal
